# mqtt-panel

A simple web interface which is able to subscribe to a MQTT topic and display
the information. 

The screenshot shows an example how to keep track on what's going in your
apartment or your house. It's not about controlling, this setup is about 
observing various states.

## Prerequisites/Installation

### Get the files
Clone the `mqtt-panel` [repository](https://github.com/fabaff/mqtt-panel)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:fabaff/mqtt-panel.git
```

### Dependencies
`mqtt-panel` is using the listed projects to provide its functionality: 

- [paho-mqtt](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/python/)
- [mqtt](https://github.com/adamvr/MQTT.js/)

If you are using Fedora and want to generate MQTT messages, install the 
`paho-mqtt` Python bindings.

```
$ sudo dnf -y install python-paho-mqtt
``` 

### MQTT broker/server
A MQTT broker/server with Websocket support is needed. 

- [hbmqtt](https://github.com/beerfactory/hbmqtt) - MQTT broker with build-in
  websockets capabilities
- [mosca](http://mcollina.github.io/mosca/) - A multi-transport MQTT broker
  for node.js
- [mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) - An Open Source MQTT v3.1 broker

## Running mqtt-panel

1. Make sure that your MQTT broker/server is running and listening. Or run
   `python3 mqtt-server.py` to use `mqtt-panel` with [hbmqtt](https://github.com/beerfactory/hbmqtt)
   (make sure that you installed it with `pip3 install hbmqtt`).
2. Adjust `var host = '127.0.0.1';` and `var port = 3000;` in the file
   `index.html` to match your setup if you are not using `mqtt-server.py`.
3. Open `index.html`.

## Generate MQTT messages

Start the `./test-messages.py` script to publish test messages if you have
no other source for messages. Depending on your broker you may need to set
the supported version. On line 33: `protocol=mqtt.MQTTv311`

For manually sending messages to your MQTT broker/server you can use 
`mosquitto_pub` from `mosquitto` or `hbmqtt_pub`.

```
$ mosquitto_pub -V mqttv311 -h localhost -d -t home/front/door -m "false"
```

To check if the messages are are ok, subscribe to the topic **home/#** with 
`mosquitto_sub`.

```
$ mosquitto_sub -V mqttv311 -h localhost -d -t home/#
```
